Kubernetes
----------
K8s is  an open source orchestration platform-managing docker container of u application->container->where application deployment happen
K8s used to manage containers
K8s developed in Gogle & CNCF
kubernate is framework to handle container related tasks (managing complex task of deploying ,scaling and operating applications in containers)
application 
				ecommerce portal

   product  order  customer payment	 cart service  wishlistservice

every service we need to create docker container
create container,delete container ,(scale up)increase,(scale down)descres complete manage take care by kubernate.


Advantage
----------
container orchestration-manage container
scalablitity-increase /descrese container based demand
self healing-any container is damage.to resolve problem kubernetes.kubernate replace with another container
load balance-application run multiple container-kubernate take load -distribute load to all container
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
K8S Architecture
================
K8S work based cluster architecture
=cluster-group servers'

control plane/master node-manage everything  in kubernate (task give to control plane)-master node
  1)api server
  2)scheduer
  3)conrollermanager
  etcd

worker Nodes-perform task based instruction
POD
container
docker engine
kublet
kube proxy

To communicate with control plane 
UI-web dashboard
CLI-kubectl-cLu is used to communicate with control plane

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
component
==========
Api server will recive income request (deploy application,increse scale)  and it will store request into ETCD Database

etcd-stores request infromation 

scheduler-pending task in ETCD  and it will assign to worker

schedular will get avaiable worker nodes information by using kubelet

kubelet is called as worker node agent

kube -proxy  provies network for cluster communiction


POD is smallest builing block that we run in kubernetes cluster .

POD represent runtime instance of our application

notein k8s, our project will executed as pOD. inside pod containers will created

cntroller-manager-will monitor all k8s resourcefunctinality

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kubernetes cluster setup
we set up in multiple ways
self manage k8s cluster
mini kube(single node cluster)
kubeadm(multi cluster

managed k8S cluster
AWS EKS
Azure Aks
gcp gke
ibm ike


provider manager cluster
========================
no need to install every thing.

launh instance
eksHostVM
ubuntu-
key-pair
eks
ALLow SSH


opengit bash
-------------------
chmod 400 "eks.pem'
connet ec2 instance
ssh -i "eks.pem " 
yes
clear
whoami
kubectl install
AWScli  install
install eksctl

K8s manifest yml syntax
====================
api version:app/v1
kind:deployment
metadata:
 name:javawebappdeployment
spec:
replicas:2
strategy :
 type:RollingUpdate
