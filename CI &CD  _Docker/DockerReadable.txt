What Docker?
>it is free and open source software

>Docker is containerization platform 

>containerization means packages our application code+required dependencies as single unit for execution.

>Deployement into multiplr environemnts will become easy if we use docker container concept

Advantages Going docker
=========================
if you want to run application 

For example if you take a spring boot application in order torun that spring boot application we need java 
softwareif want to use a database for our application then we need java +databaseis need to run our application

whenever we develop our application directly we cannot give  to the client for execution we nee test application 
in multiple environment then only we will give to client
So we going to test in the dev,test,uat and prod.when we test our application in multiple environement
what about software required to run Java+Mysql in all machines.that will take alot time.

To reduce that problem we going to use Docker containers here when we go for Docker containersour application 
will execute inside container and that docker software take care of all required software those are called
as dependencies of application
Torun application we need java ,java is dependent for spring boot application
if you have database  will db will dependency for our application instead of we 
ae installing all the dependencies in all machines we are going to use Docker
Docker will provide the infrastructure to run our applicationeasily in any platform
 in any machine that why docker is called docker trending in market

How dockerize aplication
========================
1)Docker file-it contains set of instruction to buid dockerr image

2)docker image-it is package which contain codee+dependceies

3)docker registry-it is place where we can store our docker image

4)docker container-when we run docker image then docker container will be created.our application will executed inside docker container.

Docker Set up
===============
1)create Linux vm and connect to it using Mobaxterm

install docker in Amzon linux VM

$sudo yum update -y
$sudo yum install docker -y
$sudo service docker start

add ec2-user to dockergroup by executing below command
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

Restart sesioon

$exit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring Boot App with Docker

create spring boot application

Package Booot ap using mvn clean package'

write docker file to build docker image

create docker image using Dockerfile

run dockerimage(it will create container)

access appliction in browser
