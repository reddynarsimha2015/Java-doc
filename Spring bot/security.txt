what is security?
security protecting your data and business logic 
inside your web application.

security is very important similar to scalablity,
performance and availablity no client will specifically 
asks that i need security

security should be considered right from development 
phase itself along with business logic

security for web application will be implmented in
different ways like using firwells,https,ssl,authenication
authorization etc.

why security important
security doesnt mean only loosing data or money but
also brand and trust from your user which you have
 built over years
