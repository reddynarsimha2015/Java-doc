Stream
=======
A Stream in Java can be defined as a sequence of elements from
a source.The source of elements here refers to a Collection or
Array

Streams can be used for filtering, collecting, printing,
and converting from one data structure to another, etc. 

Note: 
If we want to represent a group of objects as a single entity 
then we should go for collection.
But if we want to process objects from the collection
then we should go for streams

Streams are present in javaâ€™s utility package named 
java.util.stream
